Adding internal Links in your slides

Start by giving your target slide a unique id attribute. 
Next, you can create an anchor with an href in the format #/<id>. 
Here's a complete working example:

<section>
	<a href="#/grand-finale">Go to the grand-finale slide</a>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Slide 2</h2>
</section>

<section id="grand-finale">
	<h2>The end</h2>
	<a href="#/0">Back to the first</a>
</section>
