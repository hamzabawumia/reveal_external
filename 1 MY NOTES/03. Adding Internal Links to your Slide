Adding internal Links in your slides

Start by giving your target slide a unique id attribute. 
Next, you can create an anchor with an href in the format #/<id>. 
Here's a complete working example:

<section>
	<a href="#/grand-finale">Go to the grand-finale slide</a>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Slide 2</h2>
</section>

<section id="grand-finale">
	<h2>The end</h2>
	<a href="#/0">Back to the first</a>
</section>


Numbered Links

It's also possible to link to slides based on their slide index. 
The href format for an numbered link is #/0 where 0 is the horizontal slide number. 
To link to a vertical slide use #/0/0 where the second number is the index of the vertical slide target.

<a href="#/2">Go to 2nd slide</a>
<a href="#/3/2">Go to the 2nd vertical slide inside of the 3rd slide</a>
