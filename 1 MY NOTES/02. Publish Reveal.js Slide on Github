Yes, you can publish your Reveal.js presentation (or ebook) on GitHub using GitHub Pages. 
GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. 
Here’s how you can publish your Reveal.js project on GitHub Pages:

### 1. **Prepare Your Project**

Ensure your Reveal.js project is set up correctly and works locally. 
Your project should have the following structure:

```
/my-reveal-project
  /css
  /js
  /lib
  /slides
  index.html
  README.md
```

### 2. **Create a GitHub Repository**

1. **Create a New Repository**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository. 
	You can name it something like `my-reveal-presentation`.

2. **Initialize the Repository**: You can initialize it with a README if you like, but it’s not necessary.

### 3. **Push Your Project to GitHub**

1. **Initialize Git in Your Project Folder**: Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder. Initialize a Git repository and add your files.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/my-reveal-project
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. **Add Remote and Push**: Add the remote repository and push your files.

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-reveal-presentation.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 4. **Configure GitHub Pages**

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**: Go to the repository on GitHub and click on the `Settings` tab.

2. **Scroll to GitHub Pages Section**: In the "Code and automation" section, find the "Pages" option 
		on the left sidebar.

3. **Select the Branch**: Under "Build and deployment", select the branch you want to use 
	(usually `main` or `master`). 
	Set the root directory if your files are in the root of the repository. 
	If your project is in a subdirectory (like `/docs`), you would select that directory.

4. **Save Settings**: Click "Save" to apply the settings.

### 5. **Access Your Published Site**

After a few moments, GitHub Pages will publish your site. 
You can access it via the URL provided in the GitHub Pages settings. 
It usually follows the format:

```
https://yourusername.github.io/my-reveal-presentation/
```

### 6. **Update and Maintain**

1. **Make Changes Locally**: Edit your files as needed and commit the changes.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update content"
   git push
   ```

2. **GitHub Pages Updates**: 
	Your GitHub Pages site will automatically update with the changes you push to the repository.

### Additional Tips

- **Custom Domain**: If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in the GitHub Pages settings.
- **Automatic Deployment**: GitHub Actions can be used for more advanced deployment scenarios, 
	including automatic deployments when changes are made.

	By following these steps, you can publish your Reveal.js presentation on GitHub Pages, 
	making it accessible to anyone with the link.
