You can use HTML inside Markdown, so you would just need to enclose all the content of the md file in an HTML tag 
(like <div> or <section>):

<section data-markdown="section-1.md"></section>
Where section-1.md is:

<div>
  <h2>Title</h2>
</div>

PROBLEM: the slides load slowly if you use too many markdown "includes"

the better solution is to use:
