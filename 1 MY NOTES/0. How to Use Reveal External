1. To set up a new presentation:
      - Ensure that you have nodejs and npm installed --- 
	  
	  				sudo apt update
					sudo apt install nodejs
					sudo apt install npm
					
					
					To check which version of Node.js you have installed, type:

    		`				nodejs -v

      - Ensure that you have node http-server installed
	  
	  			Installation via npm:

 						sudo npm install http-server -g

				This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line.
				
				
2. NOW lets install reveal_external:

			create a new folder where you want to have your presentation
			cd into the new folder 
			Install with npm: 
				npm install reveal_external
				
3. cd into the reveal_external folder (YOUR_BASE_DIRECTORY_node_modules\reveal_external) where you have external_external installed
		then run:
		http-server -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1
		
		
4. You can view your presentation at: http://localhost:8000
		use your browser to navigate to your presentation's index.html
